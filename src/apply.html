                            You'll be involved in the technical and graphical aspects of pages and will determine the
                            look of the website as well as how it works. You may also be responsible for the maintenance
                            of an existing site.<br>
                            The term web developer is sometimes used interchangeably with web designer, but this is
                            misguided. Web developing is a more specialist role, focusing on the back-end development of
                            a website, using programming languages to make the web design a reality that works well.<br>
                            The growth in touchscreen phones and tablet devices has dictated a new way of designing
                            websites, with the web designer needing to ensure that web pages are responsive no matter
                            what type of device is being used. Therefore, the need to test websites at different stages
                            of design and on a variety of devices, has become an important aspect of the job.<br>
                            We are seeking a talented Web Designer to work with our team of programmers, and to join our
                            ever-expanding creative team. <br><br>

                            You will:<br>
